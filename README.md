I used JavaScript and d3 tooltips to create a dynamic chart. The display shows a graph with three different choices for the x-axis (poverty, age, household income) and three different choices for the y-axis (lack of healthcare, smokers, and obesity), allowing a user to see different comparisons.
This scatter plot is displaying the data by U.S. states. The state abbreviations appear on the circles of the scatter plot, and when the user hovers over the circle, a box pops up containing data for the chosen axes.

Chart with the percent of people in poverty on the x-axis and the percent who lack healthcare on the y-axis. The image shows the pop-up window that appears when a user clicks on one of the states.

Notice how the axes scales change when the user clicks on different x- and y-axis options. This chart shows median household income on the x-axis and the percent of people who smoke on the y-axis.

Data Source: [Census Data](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml). 
The data is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates and includes rates of income, obesity, smoking, healthcare, and poverty by state.
