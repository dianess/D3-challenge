# D3-challenge

In this challenge, I used d3 to load data contained in a csv file and also used d3 tooltips so that state abbreviations appear
on the circles of a scatter plot. D3 also allows for a box containing information about each circle when the user hovers over that circle. The display shows a graph with three different choices for the x-axis (poverty, age, household income) and three different choices for the y-axis (lack of healthcare, smokers, and obesity), allowing a user to see different comparisons. 


Data Source: https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates. The data set includes rates of income, obesity, smoking, healthcare, and poverty by state.
